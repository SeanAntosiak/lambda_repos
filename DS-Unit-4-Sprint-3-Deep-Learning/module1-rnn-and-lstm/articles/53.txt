The threat to hard-won women’s rights in Rojava is receiving little coverage in the context of Turkey’s military campaign, but women there say Turkish aggression could wipe out these reforms and perhaps herald a return to the misogyny and sexual violence of militant Islamism. There is widespread concern about the possible escape of ISIS prisoners held by Kurdish forces, and on Sunday, it was reported that at least 750 people suspected of affiliation with ISIS fled a secure displacement camp in the chaos caused by Turkish shelling. In addition, several dozen “high-value” ISIS prisoners were reportedly left behind by U.S. troops when they retreated, the New York Times reported, and ISIS has already claimed at least two attacks in the area since the invasion started, including a car bombing that killed three people.
