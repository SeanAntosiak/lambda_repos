“The Queen’s Speech” is designed to acknowledge the 400 years of tradition in the cradle of parliamentary democracy and the ongoing — although mostly symbolic — role of the monarch. It is usually a jolly good show, broadcast live, complete with men in wigs bearing ceremonial purses, yeomen in scarlet tunics and lords in robes. There is also a 41-gun salute and a mock search of the Palace of Westminster’s cellars for explosives.

As for the speech itself? The prime minister and his ministers actually write it. The address lays out the government’s agenda — even while it remains uncertain how long Johnson’s minority government may last.

And so the queen began her scripted remarks saying her government’s priority “has always been to secure the United Kingdom’s departure from the European Union on 31 October.”

While the debate over Johnson’s domestic agenda begins Monday afternoon at Westminster Palace, all eyes in the chamber will be scrolling the screens of their smartphones for news from Brussels, where British and European negotiators are in their third day of secret talks over the fate of Brexit.

One of the leaders of the opposition Labour Party, Diane Abbott, panned Monday’s performance, calling it “farcical.” Another Labour lawmaker, Anna Turley, tweeted after the speech: “All that pomp and felt like a damp squib. If that’s the summit of the vision of a new Prime Minister who has spent his whole life planning how to get to Downing Street, I’d have hoped for so much more to transform our broken economy, services and society.”

Meanwhile, in Brussels, depending upon the hour, reports have been cautiously optimistic or profoundly pessimistic, as negotiators struggle to agree to a deal. The challenge remains what to do about the border on the island of Ireland — and how to preserve both British sovereignty alongside the E.U.’s demands to protect its single market and customs union.

In her speech, the queen ticked off 22 new bills comprising Johnson’s domestic proposals. The policy announcements included stiffer penalties for some offenders; an end to “freedom of movement” for E.U. citizens coming to Britain and efforts to introduce a points-based immigration policy similar to Australia’s; and a new environment bill that will set binding targets on reducing plastic use, cutting air pollution and restoring biodiversity.

Johnson’s attorney general, Geoffrey Cox, has dismissed this House of Commons as a “zombie” Parliament paralyzed over Brexit: It may go on and on but never dies; it just eats the brains of its captives. A general election looms.

The opposition parties say the Johnson government lacks the majority it needs to pass any of the measures outlined in the speech.

Since Johnson became prime minister, his working majority has plummeted from one to minus 43. Johnson lost his reliable votes after 21 Conservative lawmakers — including Winston Churchill’s grandson — were kicked out of the party for backing legislation aimed at stopping a no-deal Brexit.

In the three-year-long psychodrama of Brexit, the British press has labeled many weeks “make-or-break,” with the government facing crunch deadlines.

On Monday, the Telegraph newspaper called this crunch “the crunchiest” deadline of all.

The 28 European leaders will met at the E.U. Council on Thursday and Friday in Brussels. They say this is the last possible opportunity for the heads of the 27 other nations to agree to a Brexit deal — at least in theory.

On Saturday, Johnson will face a rare Saturday session of Parliament — only four times, since Hitler invaded Poland, has the House of Commons convened on a Saturday.

The lawmakers earlier passed a bill that forbids Johnson from leaving the E.U. this month without a deal. Johnson has repeatedly called it the “Surrender Act.” The prime minister has vowed to leave — “do or die” — on Oct. 31.

If Britain fails to craft a Brexit deal with the Europeans this week, most observers say he will reluctantly find a way to seek an extension — most likely to stage an election sometime this fall.

If, however, Johnson cuts a deal, then it will be debated in Parliament on Saturday. Would it, could it pass? Nobody knows. Johnson has lost seven consecutive votes in the House of Commons. The opposition parties have already said they would vote against the deal, whatever it is.

Johnson’s latest Brexit proposals were first rejected last week in Europe. But Irish Prime Minister Leo Varadkar met with Johnson and came away saying they could imagine a landing zone for a deal. Then the E.U. and British specialists went into talks.

In Brussels, the bureaucrats were mostly gloomy about the chances of a deal; the politicians, however, were less so. The European Union is also famous for crafting deals at five minutes to midnight.

The stumbling block this week — as it has been for two years — is what to do about the border between the Republic of Ireland and the territory of Northern Ireland.

After Brexit, Northern Ireland will remain in the United Kingdom, while Ireland will remain part of the E.U. How to control and inspect the flow of people, capital and goods — especially agricultural products such as meat — and how to collect customs tariffs between the two entities is the knot that must be untied.

In his latest overtures, Johnson has proposed that Northern Ireland would essentially remain in the British customs union, but follow E.U. customs rules.
