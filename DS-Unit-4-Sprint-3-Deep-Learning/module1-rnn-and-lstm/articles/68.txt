In response to Monday’s ruling, separatist sympathizers in Catalonia vowed massive civil disobedience in a rejection of a process they deemed overly harsh. Police forces descended on Barcelona, the Catalan capital, as demonstrators marched on major transit hubs, including the city’s international airport.

Catalan officials attacked what they considered excessively harsh sentences and called on the Spanish government to negotiate a different solution. But Madrid refused to back down and urged respect for the rule of law.

“We tended to think that this was something impossible in 20th-century Europe; now we see that it is possible,” Alfred Bosch, Catalonia’s minister for foreign action, institutional relations and transparency, told The Washington Post. “Political leaders were condemned to 100 years in jail because they held a vote,” he said referring to the cumulative length of all the sentences.

“Right now, in the heart of Europe, it’s really worrisome and troubling.”

But Pedro Sánchez, Spain’s acting prime minister, defended the ruling.

“In a social and democratic state of law, compliance means full compliance,” he told reporters. “This has been a judicial process with full guarantees and transparency.”

“The government of Spain will work in the coming days toward guaranteeing public order and protecting our democratic laws as it has always done.”

At least one Catalan civic group said it would respect the court’s ruling. In a statement, the Catalan Civil Society urged local authorities “not to call for confrontation.” But others, such as FC Barcelona, one of the world’s most popular soccer teams, objected to the prison sentences. “Prison is not the solution,” the group said in a statement.

Three other defendants were found guilty merely of disobedience, which means they will be fined but not serve prison time. All 12 defendants were acquitted of the more serious charge of rebellion, but top Catalan officials were given the lengthier sentences.

Spanish prosecutors initially sought a prison term of 25 years for Oriol Junqueras, Catalonia’s former vice president and the highest-ranking Catalan official on trial. Junqueras was ultimately sentenced to 13 years, the longest the court handed down.

After the ruling, Junqueras said Monday that Catalan independence was “closer than ever.” His comments were relayed by his Republic Left party.

“A total of 100 years of prison. How horrible. Now more than ever, we will be with you and your families. For the future of our sons and daughters. For democracy. For Europe. For Catalonia,” Carles Puigdemont, a former regional president of Catalonia, said in a statement on Twitter. Puigdemont fled Spain to Belgium after calling the 2017 referendum.

Spain on Monday renewed its extradition request for Puigdemont.

The ruling looks set to play a role in Spanish elections in early November, the fourth vote the country has held in four years. Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez, a Socialist, was unable to form a government after winning a general election in April, largely because of a standoff with smaller parties on the far left and political center.

Political analysts viewed the vote in the context of Spain’s mounting political fragmentation. There are two political parties in the Spanish parliament that support Catalan independence, and it was unclear how the verdict in the Catalan trial would affect the upcoming election.

“It’s either going to get the pro-independence political parties more votes, or people will come to the conclusion that we’ve been through this now, we have a sentence, and they won’t get votes,” said William Chislett, an analyst at the Elcano Royal Institute, a Madrid think tank.

“Which way it’s going to go is anybody’s guess,” he said.
