- What went well (in the context of working on the assignment) today?

  The deployment went well, I was able to get the app running with very minimal
  bug fixing.

- What was particularly interesting or surprising about the topic(s) today?

  When I was finishing the implementation of the prediction.py I had a lot of  
  errors, but with debug mode they were very easy to find and fix. The debug
  mode highlighting where in my code the error originated from and the error
  code. I was able to fix about 15 errors in a row in just a few minutes.


- What was the most challenging part of the work today, and why?

  The most challenging part was realizing that my app was working once it was
  deployed. When I first tried to load to app I had to reset the database and
  it looked like it was working. From there I tried to add some names and would
  only get an error sometimes. Eventually (with the help of my TL) I found out
  that the issue was most likely a time out issue.
