- What went well (in the context of working on the assignment) today?

  I was easily able to set up and get a basic flask app to run.

- What was particularly interesting or surprising about the topic(s) today?

  I was interested in going a little deeper with learning how function decorators.
  I was actually looking up how to use them to move my unit 1 project to a
  dash app, so its nice to know we will be going over them at least a little bit
  this sprint.

- What was the most challenging part of the work today, and why?

  It was difficult to set up the database with fake twitter data. I was following
  along with the lecture code but ran into some issues with creating a database
  for the user and tweet to populate.
