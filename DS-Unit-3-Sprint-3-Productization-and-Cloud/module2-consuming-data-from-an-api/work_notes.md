- What went well (in the context of working on the assignment) today?

  I ran into a lot of bugs today but I was quickly able to look through the
  error messages and figure out what the problem was and solve the issues with
  my team lead. So solving errors went well today.

- What was particularly interesting or surprising about the topic(s) today?

  I was interested in seeing the different methods web searches were encoded with such as
  the percent encoder. It was also interesting to see how powerful API
  keys are and just how much information I could get from tweepy with a couple lines of code.

- What was the most challenging part of the work today, and why?

  The hardest part of the assignment today was finding out how to fix a
  specific error in which I misspelled base.html as base.hmtl I knew the error
  was related to this template because of the error message, but I did not
  notice it was misspelled even though it was misspelled in the error message.
