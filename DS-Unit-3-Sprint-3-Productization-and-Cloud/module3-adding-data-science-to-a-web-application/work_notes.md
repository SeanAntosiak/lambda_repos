- What went well (in the context of working on the assignment) today?

  I was able to understand what was going on with the video lecture and understand the code as I was writing it along with the lectures.

- What was particularly interesting or surprising about the topic(s) today?

  the prediction.py file was very short for what it was doing, I was impressed by how much it was able to do in so few lines of code (assuming
  I already have a database with users and tweets)

- What was the most challenging part of the work today, and why?

  I had an error in which it was saying there was a data type error with a string 'lower' in a DB.Integer column. The word lower was not anywhere in my code so this was harder to solve than most other issues I ran into. I eventually fixed this by removing parts of my code 1 by 1 that had DB.Integer and eventually made the code run by removing a non critical line. So I did not solve the issue but I did make the app run.
