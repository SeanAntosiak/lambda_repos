# Ideas for data storytelling

## You

What do you care about?

**eSports, Physics(Astronomy, Solar/renewable energy)**

What do you know about?

**eSports & Astrophysics**

What decisions do you face?

**Should I continue to work with astronomy to compliment my degree, or should I do work outside of my degree with datasets closer to what is worked with in common data science jobs?**

**Would working with eSports for my portfolio make me look less professional to employers?**

## Seven templates

Training Kit (https://learn.lambdaschool.com/ds/module/recedjanlbpqxic2r) explains the seven templates from Priceonomics.

Can you apply the templates to your topics? 

1. Geographic Variation

    **Physics: What types of renewable energy is most efficient in different geographical regions**
    
    **eSports: Does the genre of game people play depend on their proximity to a large city?**
    
2. Trend related to the news

    **Physics: Carbon footprint of the production/storage/transportation for different renewable resources**

3. Who does that?

    **eSports: Demoraphics of eSports competitors by the game they are playing**

4. Answering a question people care about

    **eSports: Does complaining negativley effect your tournament results**
    
    **Physics: Should you invest in solar for your own home? panel/instilation cost vs availalbe sunlight space**

5. Valuable to businesses

    **eSports: Do player sponsorships effect sales in the target demagraphic, and how important is tournament placing compared to          online presence when it comes to the effectivness of a sponsorship**
    
    **Physics: Is it worth upgrading to more energy efficient appliances? Cost vs use. Should you invest in solar?**

6. What's the most popular?

    **eSports: Most popular eSport by tournament entrants, active players, tournament prize pool, twitch viewing, or advertisement revenue**

7. Cost/Money rankings

    **eSports: Does tournament infrustructure investment(consoles, tvs, game copies) coralate to the popularity of the game.**
    
    **Physics: Which renewable energy source is the most cost efficient/what is the carbon foorprint of that source.**

## Misconceptions

What misconceptions do people have about your topic?

   **"Video games are a waste of time"** 
   
   **They can help you learn to: learn, be self critical, improve bad habits, thrive under pressure, understand the importance of practice, develop connections, etc**

## Examples

What data storytelling example inspires you?

Could you do a new hypothesis, for the same question?


Could you do a new question, for the same topic?


Could you do a new topic, with the same "style"?

   **I could map solar farms and change the color of the dots based on the energy they produce**


## Data

Where could you search for data about your topic?

   **Renewable Energy: Really anywhere that offers free datasets has some on this topic**
   
   **Astronomy: I can get data from my research professor if he is willing to let me continue working on the project now that I have graduated**
   
   **eSports: Hard to find, most datasets are behind paywalls or about games I don't care about**


# Assignment!

Fill out the above template *twice*, for two different ideas.

Then compare and contrast and select one as the idea you're leaning towards
working on for your project week.

   **I can not obtain eSports Datasets for the questions I want to ask, and I won't have acess to Astrophysics datasets in time for this project. I will stick with renewable energy and I will attempt to come up with a question I can answer with datsets I have found.**
