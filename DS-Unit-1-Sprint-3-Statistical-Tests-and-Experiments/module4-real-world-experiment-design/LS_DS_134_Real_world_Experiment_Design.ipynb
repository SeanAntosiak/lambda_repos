        "Python is great - but with web applications, it's impossible to avoid JavaScript. The lingua franca of the web, JavaScript runs in all browsers, and thus all front-end code must either be JS or transpiled to it. As a data scientist you don't have to learn JavaScript - but you do have to be aware of it, and being able to figure out snippets of it is an invaluable skill to connect your skills with real-world applications.\n",
