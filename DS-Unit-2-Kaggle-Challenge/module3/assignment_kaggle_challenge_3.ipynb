    "\n",
    "- **\"Categorical Encoding\":** This means using the raw categorical values as-is, not encoded. Scikit-learn doesn't support this, but some tree algorithm implementations do. For example, [Catboost](https://catboost.ai/), or R's [rpart](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/rpart/index.html) package.\n",
    "- **Numeric Encoding:** Synonymous with Label Encoding, or \"Ordinal\" Encoding with random order. We can use [category_encoders.OrdinalEncoder](https://contrib.scikit-learn.org/categorical-encoding/ordinal.html).\n",
    "- **One-Hot Encoding:** We can use [category_encoders.OneHotEncoder](http://contrib.scikit-learn.org/categorical-encoding/onehot.html).\n",

    "\n",
    "Category Encoder's mean encoding implementations work for regression problems or binary classification problems. \n",
    "\n",
    "For multi-class classification problems, you will need to temporarily reformulate it as binary classification. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "encoder = ce.TargetEncoder(min_samples_leaf=..., smoothing=...) # Both parameters > 1 to avoid overfitting\n",

    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    " dirty_cat.TargetEncoder(clf_type='multiclass-clf')\n",
    "```\n",
    "It also implements an interesting idea called [\"Similarity Encoder\" for dirty categories](https://www.slideshare.net/GaelVaroquaux/machine-learning-on-non-curated-data-154905090).\n",
    "\n",
    "However, it seems like dirty_cat doesn't handle missing values or unknown categories as well as category_encoders does. And you may need to use it with one column at a time, instead of with your whole dataframe.\n",
