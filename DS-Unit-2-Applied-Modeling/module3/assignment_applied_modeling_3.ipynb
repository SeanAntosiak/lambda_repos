    "- [ ] Continue to iterate on your project: data cleaning, exploration, feature engineering, modeling.\n",

    "## Stretch Goals\n",
    "- [ ] Make multiple PDPs with 1 feature in isolation.\n",
    "- [ ] Make multiple PDPs with 2 features in interaction.\n",
    "- [ ] If you log-transformed your regression target, then convert your PDP back to original units. \n",
    "- [ ] Use Plotly to make a 3D PDP.\n",
    "- [ ] Make PDPs with categorical feature(s). Use Ordinal Encoder, outside of a pipeline, to encode your data first. If there is a natural ordering, then take the time to encode it that way, instead of random integers. Then use the encoded data with pdpbox.I Get readable category names on your plot, instead of integer category codes.\n",
