    "Complete these tasks for your project, and document your work.\n",
    "\n",
    "- [ ] Continue to iterate on your project: data cleaning, exploratory visualization, feature engineering, modeling.\n",
    "- [ ] Make a Shapley force plot to explain at least 1 individual prediction.\n",
    "- [ ] Share at least 1 visualization on Slack.\n",

    "## Stretch Goals\n",
    "- [ ] Make Shapley force plots to explain at least 4 individual predictions.\n",
    "    - If your project is Binary Classification, you can do a True Positive, True Negative, False Positive, False Negative.\n",
    "    - If your project is Regression, you can do a high prediction with low error, a low prediction with low error, a high prediction with high error, and a low prediction with high error.\n",
    "- [ ] Use Shapley values to display verbal explanations of individual predictions.\n",
    "- [ ] Use the SHAP library for other visualization types.\n",
    "\n",
    "The [SHAP repo](https://github.com/slundberg/shap) has examples for many visualization types, including:\n",

    "- Force Plot, individual predictions\n",
    "- Force Plot, multiple predictions\n",
    "- Dependence Plot\n",
    "- Summary Plot\n",

    "- Decision Plots\n",
