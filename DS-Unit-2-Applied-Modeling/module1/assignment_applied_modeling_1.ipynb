    "Complete these tasks for your project, and document your decisions.\n",
    "\n",
    "- [ ] Choose your target. Which column in your tabular dataset will you predict?\n",
    "- [ ] Choose which observations you will use to train, validate, and test your model. And which observations, if any, to exclude.\n",
    "- [ ] Determine whether your problem is regression or classification.\n",
    "- [ ] Choose your evaluation metric.\n",
    "- [ ] Begin with baselines: majority class baseline for classification, or mean baseline for regression, with your metric of choice.\n",
    "- [ ] Begin to clean and explore your data.\n",
    "- [ ] Choose which features, if any, to exclude. Would some features \"leak\" information from the future?\n",

    "- [Attacking discrimination with smarter machine learning](https://research.google.com/bigpicture/attacking-discrimination-in-ml/), by Google Research, with  interactive visualizations. _\"A threshold classifier essentially makes a yes/no decision, putting things in one category or another. We look at how these classifiers work, ways they can potentially be unfair, and how you might turn an unfair classifier into a fairer one. As an illustrative example, we focus on loan granting scenarios where a bank may grant or deny a loan based on a single, automatically computed number such as a credit score.\"_\n",
